# ScreenRecorder
Record the activities in Computer Screen in a video file.

1. Create Folder OutputScreenRecording (in the same directory as python files)  where the output would be stored.
2. Download ffmpeg.exe in the same folder.
3. Invoking StartScreenRecord would start recording the activities in the screen.
4. Invoking StartVideoRecord would start video recording (using webcam)..
5. Invoking StopRecord would stop the recording (either screen/video whichever has started will be stopped).
